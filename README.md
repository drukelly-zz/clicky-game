# Which App Did I Open?
Test your memory by not opening the same app twice! A creative twist of the **Clicky Game**. This was built using ReactJS with `create-react-app` as the starter boilerplate to generate project files.

### Game Instructions
If the top score reaches more than 11, player wins! Otherwise, when the same app is opened before you reach the top score, the game resets.

### Other notable libraries used
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) - Probably overkill to include. All it does is displays current system time
- [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) - A lightweight CSS framework. Because, why not?
- [iOS Icon Gallery](https://www.iosicongallery.com/) - The resource I'm using to pull the images of app icons that you see on the "home screen"
